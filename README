KDE 4 KCModule

This module implements a GUI for the Wacom Linux Drivers and extends it
with profile support to handle different button / pen layouts per profile.

For hardware support have a look at http://www.linuxwacom.sourceforge.net

Easy profile switching is added via a small plasma applet.
In addition a daemon running in the background helps with hotplug support.

All tablets can be set up as long as they are found via xorg.conf or HAL configuration.

Components:
* kded:
	runs in the background, detects a connected tablet and applies the pad button / stylus profile

* kcontrol module:
	unified gui to set-up the buttons and other aspects of the tablet

* plasma-applet:
	optional applet for easy switching between different profiles

Dependencies:
* wacom tablet driver especially the xsetwacom tool

# Add missing tablet devices

If your device is not recognized by this program but you can set it up via the xsetwacom driver.
You can add the missing lines yourself.

All you need is the tabletID.

------------------------------------------------
Step 1) Get real internal Tablet name

xsetwacom list dev

for my Wacom Bamboo:
Wacom Bamboo eraser ERASER    
Wacom Bamboo cursor CURSOR    
Wacom Bamboo pad PAD       
Wacom Bamboo     STYLUS 

------------------------------------------------
Step 2) Then you need the Tablet ID

xsetwacom get "Wacom Bamboo" tabletid

for my Wacom Bamboo:
101

------------------------------------------------
Step 3) Transform it into Hexadecimal

For my Wacom Bamboo: 0065

------------------------------------------------
Step 4) Add a new section into the right datafile
look at /usr/share/kde4/apps/wacomtablet/data/

for the Wacom Bamboo the right file is: wacom_devicelist

Add a new entry

for my Wacom Bamboo:

[0065]
model=MTE_450        # try to google for it but not used right now
layout=bl_6          # can be empty if no button layout is available that exists (see images dir)
name=Wacom Bamboo    # name as found above
padbuttons=4         # available buttons on the pad
wheel=no             
touchring=yes
touchstripl=no
touchstripr=no
